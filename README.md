# Welcome to GISELE!

GISELE (Geographic Information System for ELectric-Grid Evaluation) is an open-source project
that seeks to combine the latest advances in machine learning with powerful open-source GIS Software
to provide insights to research teams on the most immediately addressable ways to decarbonize the electric grid.

This project is still in its infancy. The immediate road-map is as follows:
- Configure cloud-based services using Terraform for the easy deployment of servers needed to run the application
- Launch QGIS software on the cloud-based server and configure for ease of access to users
- Provide scripting to easily download publicly available data-set onto the server
- Visualize publicly available data-sets using the QGIS software
